# Blackjack

This project was done to learn Python 3.

Running this Python 3 file in the command line allows you to play American Blackjack.

**Features:**
- One card deck
- Dealer must stand on all 17 except soft 17.
- Double on any two cards, including split pairs.
- Split once
- No betting of money

Note that I tried my best to follow the rules of the most commmon variant(s) of American Blackjack.
